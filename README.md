Alternatively, those that are comfortable reading a little bit of code can view a full list of effects in [TerrariaPack.cs](https://github.com/DavidF-Dev/Terraria-Crowd-Control/blob/main/TerrariaPack.cs).

## Usage

Firstly, the mod requires [tModLoader](https://tmodloader.net/) for Terraria 1.4, which can be downloaded for free on Steam.<br>
Older versions are not supported.<br><br>

The mod can be installed in a few ways:

- [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2833108684) **(recommended)**
- tModLoader in-game Mod Browser: search for, and download `Crowd Control for Terraria`
- GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/DavidF-Dev/Terraria-Crowd-Control/releases): place the `.tmod` file
  in `Documents/My Games/Terraria/tModLoader/Mods`

### Starting Crowd Control
To begin playing, simply join a single-player or multi-player world (*the server must also have the mod installed*).
Upon entering the world, the mod will begin attempting to connect to the Crowd Control application.
Ensure that you have the application set up and running correctly by following [this guide](https://crowdcontrol.live/setup).

<br><br>
You will be notified via the in-game chat when the mod successfully connects to the Crowd Control application. At this point, your viewers can begin affecting your game through the Crowd Control Twitch extension!

### Configuration

The effects and prices can be configured through the Crowd Control application, however the mod also offers additional options through the in-game configuration menu.<br>
A few to highlight include:

- Disable effect messages in chat. This is useful if you would like to use the Crowd Control Browser Source.
- Display anonymous viewer names in chat.
- Alter the respawn time, so that you can get back into the gameplay sooner after dying.
- Enable spawn protection. Useful in stopping your spawn point from becoming a massive crater.
- Disable tombstones, so that you're world does not become one big graveyard.
- Enable the ability to teleport to other players in multi-player freely (or with a cooldown).
