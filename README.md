A mod, for streamers, which allows viewers to spend money on in-game effects via the [Crowd Control](https://crowdcontrol.live/) Twitch extension.
- Effects and prices can be customised through the Crowd Control application.
- Built for Terraria 1.4: Journey's End.
- Supports single-player **and** multi-player.
- A fun way to earn revenue and grow your community!

## Effects
The mod features a wide variety of effects. It's up to the viewers whether they want to help you on your Terraria quest, or try to set you back as much as possible.<br>
Here is just a taste of the effects that this mod has to offer:
- Explode the player
- Enable 'god-mode'
- Reforge weapons and tools
- Drop the player's items
- Spawn mobs
- Provide buffs and de-buffs
- Increase movement speed and jump-height
- Flip the screen
- Provide weapons
- Heal the player
- Hurt the player
- and... (my personal favourite)... summon a giant wall of fish

## Usage
Firstly, the mod requires [tModLoader](https://tmodloader.net/) for Terraria 1.4, which can be downloaded for free on Steam.<br>
Older versions are not supported.<br>
<br>
The mod can be installed in two ways:
- Using the Mod Browser in tModLoader (**recommended**): search for, and download `Crowd Control for Terraria`.
- Manually from the [Releases](https://github.com/DavidF-Dev/Terraria-Crowd-Control/releases) page: place the `.tmod` file in `Documents/My Games/Terraria/ModLoader/Mods`.

### Starting Crowd Control
To begin playing, simply join a single-player or multi-player world (*the server must also have the mod installed*). 
Upon entering the world, the mod will begin attempting to connect to the Crowd Control application.
Ensure that you have the application set up and running correctly by following [this guide](https://crowdcontrol.live/setup).
<br><br>
You will be notified via the in-game chat when the mod successfully connects to the Crowd Control application. At this point, your viewers can begin affecting your game through the Crowd Control Twitch extension!

### Configuration
The effects and prices can be configured through the Crowd Control application, however the mod also offers additional options through the in-game configuration menu.<br>
A few to highlight include:
- Disable effect messages in chat. This is useful if you would like to use the Crowd Control Browser Source.
- Alter the respawn time, so that you can get back into the gameplay sooner after dying.
- Enable spawn protection. Useful in stopping your spawn point from becoming a massive crater.
- Disable tombstones, so that you're world does not become one big graveyard.
