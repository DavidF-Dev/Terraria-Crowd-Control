Upon entering the world, the mod will begin attempting to connect to the Crowd Control application. Ensure that you have the application set up and running correctly by following [url=https://crowdcontrol.live/setup]this guide[/url].

You will be notified via the in-game chat when the mod successfully connects to the Crowd Control application. At this point, your viewers can begin affecting your game through the Crowd Control extension!

[h2]Configuration[/h2]
The effects and prices can be configured through the Crowd Control application, however the mod also offers additional options through the in-game configuration menu.
A few to highlight include:
[list]
[*] Disable effect messages in chat. This is useful if you would like to use the Crowd Control Browser Source.
[*] Display anonymous viewer names in chat.
[*] Alter the respawn time, so that you can get back into the gameplay sooner after dying.
[*] Enable spawn protection. Useful in stopping your spawn point from becoming a massive crater.
